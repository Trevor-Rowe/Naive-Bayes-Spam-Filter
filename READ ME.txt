A Naive Bayes spam filter with guidance from chapter 13 of 'Data Science from Scratch' by Joel Grus.

Notes:
 
* Instead of multiplying probabilities outright, they are instead added logarithmically to prevent floating point values from quicly converging to 0.
* Added a smoothing factor k, to avoid an influx of Type 2 errors (an email is not marked as spam even if it should be)
* This is a basic filter, only the subject lines of the email are taken into consideration when making a spam determination.
